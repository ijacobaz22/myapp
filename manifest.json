  "description": "Through this extension, when you type in a password to a any website on google.com, you may type in a very simple password. But what happens is the software/company you typed your password into gets an encrypted password sent to them, so they cannot see your password. This is a very useful extension so your information can be secured and safe all the time. So far our extension has a 100% suceed rate with encrypted your passwords.",
